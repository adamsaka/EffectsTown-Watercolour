# Watercolour Texture Plug-In
A watercolour texture plugin for After Effects and OpenFX.

Details: [https://www.effects.town/effects/watercolour-texture/](https://www.effects.town/effects/watercolour-texture/)

This is a simple plug-in I built test intergrating OpenFX and After Effects into the same source tree.
